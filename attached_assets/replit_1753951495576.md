# Stock Prediction Platform

## Overview

This is a modular stock prediction platform built with Streamlit that provides real-time stock analysis and prediction capabilities. The application is designed with a beginner-friendly approach, featuring a clean separation of concerns through modular architecture. The platform fetches real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance and provides various prediction algorithms with an extensible framework for adding new algorithms.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit-based web interface with tabbed navigation
- **Data Layer**: Yahoo Finance API integration for real-time stock data
- **Algorithm Layer**: Pluggable prediction algorithms starting with Simple Moving Average
- **Orchestration Layer**: Predictor class that coordinates data fetching and algorithm execution
- **Utility Layer**: Reusable components for charts, data processing, and validation

The architecture prioritizes modularity and extensibility, making it easy to add new prediction algorithms and data sources without modifying existing code.

## Key Components

### 1. Main Application (`app.py`)
- **Purpose**: Entry point and UI orchestration
- **Architecture Decision**: Uses Streamlit for rapid prototyping and beginner-friendly interface
- **Key Features**: Tabbed interface, session state management, responsive layout

### 2. Data Fetcher (`modules/data_fetcher.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized data retrieval from Yahoo Finance
- **Architecture Decision**: Separated to isolate external dependencies and enable easy data source switching
- **Key Features**: Caching mechanism (5-minute TTL), error handling, symbol validation

### 3. Algorithms (`modules/algorithms.py`)
- **Purpose**: Container for prediction algorithms
- **Architecture Decision**: Plugin-style architecture for easy algorithm addition
- **Current Implementation**: Simple Moving Average as baseline
- **Future Extensibility**: Ready for Linear Regression, LSTM, Prophet integration

### 4. Predictor (`modules/predictor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the prediction process
- **Architecture Decision**: Facade pattern to provide clean interface between UI and business logic
- **Key Features**: Algorithm selection, prediction caching, error handling

### 5. Utilities (`modules/utils.py`)
- **Purpose**: Reusable components for visualization and data processing
- **Architecture Decision**: Separated to avoid code duplication and ensure consistency
- **Key Features**: Interactive Plotly charts, data validation, formatting utilities

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User selects stock symbol and prediction parameters through Streamlit interface
2. **Data Fetching**: StockDataFetcher retrieves historical data from Yahoo Finance API
3. **Algorithm Selection**: User chooses from available prediction algorithms
4. **Prediction Processing**: StockPredictor orchestrates data processing and algorithm execution
5. **Visualization**: ChartUtils creates interactive charts with historical data and predictions
6. **Caching**: Results are cached to improve performance and reduce API calls

## External Dependencies

### Primary Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for rapid prototyping and deployment
- **yfinance**: Yahoo Finance API wrapper for stock data
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computing
- **plotly**: Interactive visualization library

### Architecture Rationale
- **Yahoo Finance**: Chosen for free real-time data access and reliability
- **Streamlit**: Selected for beginner-friendly development and built-in deployment capabilities
- **Plotly**: Preferred over matplotlib for interactive charts and professional appearance

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for simple deployment with minimal configuration:

- **Target Platform**: Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or similar Python hosting platforms
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies specified in requirements.txt
- **Configuration**: No external configuration files required
- **Scalability**: Stateless design with caching for improved performance
